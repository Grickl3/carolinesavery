To embed a video, insert the link in the 'src' attribute starting with http, and then copy the whole iframe block and paste it (in the source code view) where you want it to be (make sure any previous content such as paragraphs have a closing tag (/p) and you paste the iframe after the closing tag before the next opening tag)
<iframe width='400' height='275' src='' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
