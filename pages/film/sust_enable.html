<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, student filmmaker Caroline Savery set out to minimize her environmental footprint to a 'sustainable' level while living in urban Pittsburgh, PA, and documenting the process for a web-based video series called Sust Enable. What at first seems like a straightforward goal&mdash;to reduce her environmental footprint to within 'one seven-billionth of the Earth'--transforms into a deep inquiry about our Western society&rsquo;s struggles to make sense of 'sustainability'. In Caroline's five-year journey to embody the true meaning of 'sustainability' in her life, we see reflections of a wide range of Americans&nbsp;grappling with the dawning awareness, devastation, and redemption in&nbsp;"living out of balance". As Caroline's awareness evolves, so too do the film's narrative and styles (coining the term 'meta-mentary' to describe the film's braiding of story themes and stylistic elements). Becoming Sustainable is a transformative film experience, not to be missed by anyone who has tried to figure out how to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>In 2008, Caroline Savery, a 21-year old environmental activist living in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, launched Sust Enable, a three-month attempt to live, as defined by the <a href="http://www.myfootprint.org/">online Ecological Footprint Calculator</a>, a &ldquo;100% sustainable&rdquo; lifestyle in urban Pittsburgh. That quest, which called for living in a tent, collecting rainwater, dumpster diving for food, and more, would be depicted in a web-based video <a href="http://www.sust-enable.com/index3.html">episode series</a>, giving viewers an example of how to implement sustainability into their own lives. Note: of eight planned and produced episodes, only the first three were released due to <a href="http://sust-enable.com/letter.html">directorial abandonment of the initial premise</a>.</p>
