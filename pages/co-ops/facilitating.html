<p><strong>You deserve to experience productive, enlivening&nbsp;meetings. &nbsp;</strong>(No, these are not a myth!)</p>
<p>Are complex issues bogging down your group, and preventing you from meeting your collective goals? Sometimes the problems may be impossible to see clearly, if you&nbsp;are deeply embedded in your group professionally, productively, and emotionally. &nbsp;Is the issue with an individual? &nbsp;With the group processes? &nbsp;Or is the&nbsp;idea or direction of the organization itself failing?</p>
<p><strong>I can help you find your way.</strong>&nbsp; I am a highly rated facilitator, whose deep background in collective and co-op organizations allows me to elicit the best ideas from the group while lightheartedly responding to people's needs for play, bonding, information, and handling of distractions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When meeting dynamics are healthy, meetings actually&nbsp;<em>do</em> accomplish things and those involved walk away feeling&nbsp;<em>more</em> empowered than if they were working on their own. &nbsp;I empathize with how&nbsp;hard this may be to imagine, if you have always experienced meetings as a headache and an obstacle! &nbsp;I can&nbsp;work comprehensively with your group in preparing for, facilitating, mediating, and/or evaluating retreats, annual meetings, special meetings, and more. &nbsp;Please <a href="#/contact">contact me</a>&nbsp;today!</p>
