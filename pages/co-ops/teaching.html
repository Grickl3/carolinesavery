<h2 style="text-align: center;">Teaching &amp; Training</h2>
<p>In 2009, I began teaching basic bicycle mechanics classes to both youth and adults in an anti-oppression, worker co-operative framework&nbsp;with <a href="http://www.freeridepgh.org/">Free Ride</a>. That experience, combined with my years of communications experience as a film producer and director, and my background in Theater of the Oppressed, awakened in me a deep passion for accessible community-based education.</p>
<p>Through offering dynamic and enriching trainings on a variety of subjects related to equitable and sustainable organizing,&nbsp;I hope to empower people and communities to better achieve their common aspirations. I offer <a href="#/co-ops/available_workshops">engaging, out-of-the-box workshops</a> on topics including co-operatives, Consensus decision-making, anti-oppression organizing, even sustainability in organizing. &nbsp;I have taught in a broad range of communities and settings.</p>

<p><strong>My Philosophy</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;There must exist a paradigm, a practical model for social change that includes an understanding of ways to transform consciousness that are linked to efforts to transform structures.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>~ bell hooks</em></blockquote>
<p>I believe accessible&nbsp;education and information is crucial to developing community resilience to oppressive structures. &nbsp;As Paolo Freire wrote, "people's education" begins with awakening people&nbsp;to themselves as Subjects, not Objects, in a historical socio-economic and cultural moment--able to act in ways that change their situations. &nbsp;After learning emerges&nbsp;practice, and&nbsp;through practice comes the physical building of alternative systems which further buffers communities from being targets of exploitation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Education is at the heart of what I do, because without education, one cannot envision, design, and act from a consciousness of alternatives. &nbsp;Even the most conventionally "well-educated" person among us may only be aware of their dominant paradigm's&nbsp;models for how resources flow and how society works.&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular (peer-to-peer) education emphasizes&nbsp;the right of any person, as an equal, to receive information and self-determine how they will utilize it in their lives and communities.</p>
