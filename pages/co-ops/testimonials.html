<h2 style="text-align: center;">Testimonials</h2>
<p>"Caroline Savery was contracted to serve as project manager for our start-up co-op. At the time she was hired, our group was a poorly organized team with a good idea. Caroline immediately flexed her "cat-herding" muscles and helped us better organize our meetings, define a mission and vision for our organization, and outline a timeline for our project's success. Through diligent research and comprehensive planning, she helped identify priorities for moving forward and the talent we had and needed in order to make our food co-op become a reality. Through her hard work and guidance, we were able to incorporate our food co-op, launch our member drive, and finalize our business plan. In just three and a half months, we have recruited over 500 members and are well on our way to opening a 10,000 sq ft storefront in Northeast Denver."</p>

<p>"The Denver Permaculture Guild hired Caroline to facilitate our second annual Steering Committee retreat. I was truly blown away by just how much our team accomplished, thanks to Caroline's expert facilitation. Caroline's approach combined just the right blend of flexibility and firmness. Caroline managed complex conversations, visioning activities, and decisions while creatively working with our team's energy levels. I am extremely satisfied with Caroline's services, and hope we can secure her for next year's retreat."</p>

<p>"I was in Consensus Decision Making and Facilitation course led by Caroline Savery at the Kingsley Center in 2010. The session was fun and informative. We learned a lot about the foundations of consensus process and how to apply those foundations to typical group decision-making settings. It was in part because of this workshop that I knew Caroline would be the right person to replace me as a cooperative development consultant in Pittsburgh when I took another position in DC. Caroline is thoughtful, professional and above all creative in her approach to community and cooperative development. I recommend Caroline very highly. She brings her best game to any endeavor she sets herself upon."</p>
