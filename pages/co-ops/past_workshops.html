<p>@ GrowHaus, 4751 York St, Denver, CO</p>

<p>sponsored by Denver Permaculture Guild</p>

<p>Consensus is a formal, equitable decision-making system designed to prioritize every person&#39;s equal democratic participation. This workshop explores the principles, structure, methods, and tools underpinning the Consensus decision-making model. After introducing the Consensus model, we will discuss common problems and solutions that emerge in Consensus, and do some hands-on practice and role-playing to try out our skills.</p>

<p>Because it requires full participation, Consensus is only successful when every person considers themselves a &quot;leader&quot; in the process, knowledgeable about how it is supposed to work and willing to keep it working well! This workshop is ideal for people who are new to Consensus, or people who are already familiar and may be using Consensus in their groups, and want to improve and practice their knowledge and skills.</p>
