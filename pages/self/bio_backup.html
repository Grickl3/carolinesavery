<h2>About Caroline/Clara</h2>
<p>Hello there. &nbsp;My name is Caroline. &nbsp;I am also known as Clara.</p>
<p>I am a multimedia artist and consultant for democratically organized groups (such as cooperatives and collectives). My main creative modes are <a href="#/writing">writing</a>, <a href="#/music">music</a> and <a href="#/film">video production</a> (somedays I <a href="http://carolinesavery.com/#/self/creative_miscellanea" target="_blank">dance</a> too!) I am shaped by my diverse life experiences and my deep inquiries into narratives, meanings of sustainability, and the teachings + practices of <a href="http://syncorsink.tumblr.com/tagged/spirituality">Buddhism</a>.</p>
<p>I practice openness and awareness whenever possible. I consider being in such a mode as akin to highly cooperative and generative state (also called <a href="https://youtu.be/fXIeFJCqsPs">&ldquo;flow&rdquo;</a>). I orient to my world with a lens of flows and rhythms of energy. This orientation unifies my diverse works.</p>
<p>Caroline is the legal name and professional appearance. Clara is the uncompromising creative force. Together they cohabit a beloved person living, working and expressing in Denver, Colorado, USA.</p>
