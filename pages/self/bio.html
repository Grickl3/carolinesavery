<h2>About Caroline/Clara</h2>

<p>Hello there.&nbsp;My name is Caroline.&nbsp;I am also known as Clara. Or Claraline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a multimedia creative and consultant/coach for democratically organized groups (such as cooperatives and collectives). My main creative modes are <a href="#/writing">writing</a>, <a href="#/music">music</a> and <a href="#/film">video production</a> (somedays I <a href="http://carolinesavery.com/#/self/creative_miscellanea" target="_blank">dance</a> too!) I am shaped by my diverse life experiences and my deep inquiries into narratives, meanings of sustainability, and the teachings and practices of <a href="http://syncorsink.tumblr.com/tagged/spirituality">Buddhism</a>.</p>

<p>I practice openness and awareness as often and as deeply as possible.&nbsp;This looks like abiding in a highly cooperative, integrative&nbsp;and generative state (also called <a href="https://youtu.be/fXIeFJCqsPs">&ldquo;flow&rdquo;</a>). I see the world through a&nbsp;lens of as&nbsp;flows and strata, patterns and&nbsp;rhythms of energy. And I tend to engage as a catalyst and vision-holder for beneficial disruptions. This overarching orientation weaves together my diverse&nbsp;body of works.</p>

<p>Thannissaro Bhikkhu in&nbsp;<em>The Karma of Question</em> says the Buddha said that &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; is an unskillful question, and I would&nbsp;tend&nbsp;to agree. I can share, however, and with some degree of acuity, about the patterns defining my existence--thanks to my&nbsp;lifelong&nbsp;stream-of-consciousness writing practice. To explore of my autobiographical writing, please attend my blog.</p>

<p>Caroline is the legal name and professional appearance. Clara is the uncompromising creative force. Together they cohabit a beloved person living, working and expressing in Denver, Colorado, USA.</p>
