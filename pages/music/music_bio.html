<h2>Artist's Bio</h2><p>As sweet as honey or the taste of steel, All-American like post-industrialist apple pie, Clara Bland deftly bridges the gaps between rock genres like so much black electrical tape. &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll blend snarky post-punk, moody goth, richly emotional folk ballads, textured skunky blues&hellip; and the outcome is yummy, if undeniably dark. &nbsp;Fearless traversing sounds, Clara can handle a creepy New-Orleans-style folk ballad just as well as a feedback-laden grunge yowl. &nbsp;May no genre go untested by Clara, who has been playing guitar for 14 years and singing for longer. &nbsp;Her ideal band would be a blend of Cub, Sebadoh and Spiritualized, with a sprinkle of the Dandy Warhols baked in.</p>
<p>Clara Bland is the musician persona of Caroline Savery, a&nbsp;multimedia-maker&nbsp;based in Denver, CO, who also moonlights&nbsp;as a <a href="http://www.carolinesavery.com/#/film">filmmaker</a>, <a href="http://www.carolinesavery.com/#/writing">writer</a>, and professional&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carolinesavery.com/#/coop">democratic organizations designer and consultant</a>.</p>
