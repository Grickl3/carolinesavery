<h3>Clara Bland creates first all-electric EP “HA OH” in tribute to late musician friend Rob Doran</h3>

<p><strong>DENVER, CO: 11/25/14</strong> -- Rob Doran had an insatiable love for music and a caring heart that captivated countless people in his short life.  A well-loved percussionist, performer and music educator from Manchester, CT, Rob tragically passed away at the age of 25 in April 2013.  Shortly before his passing, fellow budding musician and childhood friend of Rob’s, Caroline Savery, had been in talks with Rob to record the drums on her first electric EP.  “We were both undergoing extremely hard times then, so we’d call each other every other day or so to support one another.”  When he passed, “it was heart-wrenching,” Caroline says, “but I knew right away that I wanted to do something with this album in Rob’s name, as a kind of testimonial to who Rob was and how he moved people.”</p>

<p>Inspired and committed to creating the album--something she admits she’s “not sure she would have done” without Rob’s influence--Caroline connected with producer Ryan Miller through a Craigslist ad, who helped her put together a studio band, record and mix the EP, all at no cost.  “I was blessed to find talented people who really believed in me and the project,” Caroline says.</p>

<p>With the album in production, Caroline reached out to Patrick Silver, Rob’s younger brother, and the pair began collaborating on setting up a memorial fund in Rob’s name that would provide scholarships to outstanding music and music education students at Manchester High School, Rob and Caroline’s alma mater.  In the process, Caroline came upon a new name for her musician persona: Clara Bland.  “It’s a name that, to me, invokes to the fearless, revved-up energy deep in each of us that thrives in the presence of music.  Rob had that, and I adopted it.”</p>

<p>It is Clara Bland’s debut album, and the first electric album from multimedia artist Caroline Savery.  In 2011 Caroline released a “living-room recorded” acoustic 12-track album, Inner Dim, available on Bandcamp.</p>

<p>HA OH is a concept album, tracing a tumble from the heights of effervescent adolescent infatuation (AGDA) to the lows of soul-searing depression (Perfect).  Caroline considers her work “genre-jamming” --experimenting and innovating on genre conventions--which you can hear on HA OH, with each song composed in a distinct style ranging in from hyper pop rock, to lo-fi garage rock, to dark spacey blues, to dissonant heavy rock.  Caroline’s aims with such experimentation is to evoke “fresh ways of looking at habitual emotional patterns that we may be stuck in.”</p>

<p>20% of HA OH’s net proceeds will go to the Rob Doran Music Scholarship Memorial Fund, supporting exceptional music students at Manchester High School with college scholarships.  Although a way to make direct donations to the fund has not been established yet, check back on carolinesavery.com/music for details in 2015.</p>

<p>No album release shows have been lined up yet, although Caroline/Clara is booking shows in the Denver, CO area, where she now lives.  For booking inquiries, contact: <a href="mailto:clara.y.soverine@gmail.com">clara.y.soverine@gmail.com</a></p>
