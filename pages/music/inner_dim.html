<h3>About:</h3>
<p>bold and bitter like Fiona Apple,<br /> snarky yet cheeky like Nellie McKay,<br /> moving and loving like Be Good Tanyas,<br /> swinging and swooning like Eilen Jewell.</p>
<p>I'm all about exploring the genres that I love and that influence me.</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Special thanks to Joy Toujours for believing in it from beginning to beyond. Special thanks to Aaron Fraser and Nate Savery for your encouragement. Thanks to Justine Michael, Eric Venuto, and Jay Johnston for contributing your time and energy to this project that means so much to me.</p>
<p>And thanks to everyone for listening!</p>
